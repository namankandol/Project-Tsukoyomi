        <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>
            Hinata is the oldest daughter of Hiashi Hyūga. When she was still a child, Hinata was almost kidnapped by the-then Head Ninja of Kumogakure, who was visiting Konoha under the guise of signing a peace treaty between their two villages. Hiashi killed him and saved Hinata, setting in motion the events that would become known as the "Hyūga Affair".Because Hiashi was the head of the Hyūga clan, Hinata was raised to be its heiress and her family expected great things from her. But even at a young age, her father came to believe that Hinata was not suited for the role of heiress, as she struggled under his gruesome training regime, on top of him also believing that her timid personality prevented her from truly excelling. When Hinata's younger sister Hanabi started displaying superior talent, Hiashi began to reconsider Hinata's selection as heiress. In the anime, Hinata and Hanabi were pitted against each other to determine who would one day lead the Hyūga. Because Hinata was unwilling to harm Hanabi - a hesitation Hanabi did not share - she was defeated, disappointing her father.Hinata was then disinherited and turned over to the care of Kurenai Yūhi.On the day of her enrolment in Konoha's Academy,Hinata was picked on by three bullies because of her unusual eyes. Naruto, despite not knowing her, immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious, and the bullies damaged the red scarf he was wearing. When he regained consciousness, Hinata thanked him for helping her and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. Hinata started watching Naruto from that point onwards, and by doing so saw Naruto's desire to gain attention and his struggle to exceed the extremely low expectations others had for him. Despite this, Naruto never lost faith in himself or his dream to become the Hokage.

        <h1>PERSONALITY</h1>
        <p>
            As a child, Hinata was soft-spoken and polite, always addressing people with proper honorifics. She is kind, always thinking of others more than for herself, caring for their feelings and well-being. She doesn't like being confrontational for any reason. This led to her being meek or timid to others, as her overwhelming kindness can render her unable to respond or act for fear of offending somebody. Her father's constant push to alter this personality trait when she was younger only made it worse, eroding Hinata's self-confidence and making her even more bashful because she gained so little faith in herself and opinions. Despite being disinherited, Hinata loves her family very much, as shown when she "agreed" to marry Toneri in order to rescue Hanabi even though she knew it meant breaking Naruto's heart and the possibility she and Toneri actually would get married. <br><br>
            Hinata's outlook sees a shift after her appointment to Team 8. Whereas her father and much of the Hyūga clan had decided she was a lost cause who would never amount to anything,her team considers her a valuable member with her special strong points. Originally, she would over-rely on her teammates, looking to them in times of difficulty to save her from situations that make her uncomfortable. It is for her teammates - among other reasons - that Hinata starts seeking to change herself, as she wishes to help the team rather than burden it. <br><br>
            Hinata's primary motivation is Naruto Uzumaki, with whom she has been fascinated since meeting him. He initially gained her attention because of his kindness to her and outspoken nature, and then kept her attention because of similarities that Hinata perceived to herself: Naruto had a painful childhood without the love of parents, a fate worse than the mere difficulty she had with her own father, and he craves the attention and acknowledgement of anybody, just as Hinata wants to please her father. But whereas Hinata lost faith in herself, Naruto always believed he can accomplish any given task if he tries hard enough. She admires him deeply for this courage and over time fell deeply in love with him, which manifests as increased shyness and speechlessness when around him, something that became apparent to everyone, apart from ironically Naruto himself. Hinata strives to prove herself to others, but mostly to gain the attention and worthiness of Naruto. She emulates him to this purpose, adopting his nindō of never giving up to improve herself. To that end, she stops running from confrontation, instead doing all that she can to face it, even in the face of failure to keep trying, and willing to risk her life for her loved ones and village. By the end of Part I, her clan's faith in her is restored and strengthened. <br><br>
            Throughout the years, Naruto remains her primary motivation; she willingly faces Pain to protect Naruto, despite knowing she has no chance of winning.She even defends Naruto from himself when he's in doubt, repeating to him his refusal to never give up. Two years after the war, upon achieving her greatest dream of having her love reciprocated by Naruto to form a deep and committed relationship together, she became more expressive about her feelings. In the anime, she is able to laugh openly because of it. After marrying Naruto and he becomes Hokage, Hinata remains supportive of him and his increased responsibilities, even though she yearns for him to be home more often. As a mother and wife, she has become a master homemaker, keeping the family well-structured yet well-adjusted and happy. While very loving and supportive of her family, she is equally strict and assertive. Her newfound structured nature made her very intimidating and more easily angered when her family acted up, easily keeping them in line and swiftly punishing them for their misconduct. She is also insightful and wise with her words, realising that her children, particularly Boruto, take after Naruto in the desire to prove themselves to others and that she must believe in them to do things on their own.

        <h1 id="appearance">APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>
            Hinata is a slender girl of fair-complexion who, as a Hyūga, her most distinguishing trait is the Byakugan, giving her featureless white eyes (lavender in the anime). She has dark blue hair that she keeps in a hime-cut of different lengths: in Part I, her hair is cut just above her forehead akin to a bowl-cut with chin-length strands framing her face; in Part II, her hair reaches her lower back and the framing strands reach shoulder-length; in The Last: Naruto the Movie, her hair extends beyond her hips and would at times tie it into a ponytail. By the time Boruto entered the Academy, she cut it into a bob-style reaching her shoulders. While short for her age as a child, she later grew to above-average height and developed a curvaceous figure. She is noted to be beautiful by Naruto and Toneri Ōtsutsuki. <br><br>
            In Part I, Hinata usually wears a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem. She also wears navy blue pants and keeps her forehead protector loosely around her neck. In Part II, she dons a loose fitting, lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour. She also wears navy blue pants, black, low-heeled sandals, and changes the cloth of her forehead protector from blue to black. Hinata switches to the standard Konoha infantry flak jacket and assorted clothing during the Fourth Shinobi World War, though she does not appear to wear a forehead protector. <br><br>
            Two years after the war, Hinata's mission attire is a light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist. She wears a pair of short dark navy shorts with thigh-high stockings and has changed her regular ninja sandals to black high-heeled boots. Overall, her attire is noticeably more form-fitting and less conservative than previously. She does not wear her forehead protector at all. Her outfits become more varied after that, changing to match the occasion or simply being more casual than her prior garb. During Hinata's and Toneri's wedding, she wore a wide black and grey top with a long grey sash around her waist. She also wore short puffy pants with black lace socks and sandals. On her head was a black turban with a black and light yellow veil over and yellow crescent moon earrings. During Hinata's and Naruto's wedding, she wore a traditional white kimono with a flower in her hair. After getting married, she consistently wears a light purple short-sleeved jacket, a long-sleeved white shirt with two pink colored strips underneath it, light brown shorts and purple open-toed boots. In the Boruto manga, Hinata has a necklace with the Uzumaki symbol on it.

        <h1 id="abilities">ABILITIES</h1>
        <p>
            Originally, Hinata's gentle personality hindered her performance, to which she was deemed too weak and unworthy for the role of heir.After committing herself getting stronger in her training for Naruto, receiving consistent praise from her team and clan for her improving skills and strengthening character. Two years after the war, Hinata, having been recognised by Hamura Ōtsutsuki as the Byakugan Princess, proves to be crucial in the destruction of the Tenseigan, even though she herself can't destroy it. Despite spending at least a decade as a housewife, she could survive an attempt to get Naruto back from Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, and even defeat Hanabi, who is an active jōnin and continues training to become the next clan leader, in a sparring match. Hinata at the time was reluctant to fight and unprepared when Hanabi attacked seriously. Despite being rusty, she was able to keep pace and soundly win the fight, making Hanabi accept the loss. <br><br>
            From her special clan training, Hinata has very advanced control of her chakra. In the anime, Hinata did additional training to expand on it during Part I; one product of this training is to make Water Needles by forming her chakra around nearby water sources and be used as a projectile. By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match a medical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. <br><br>
            As a Hyūga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, a dōjutsu that grants her penetrative vision in a near-360° around herself, with one blind spot at the back of the neck above the first thoracic vertebra.With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision in a single direction, Hinata can see across vast distances, reaching as far away as 20 kilometres by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks pinpoint accuracy, which she can share with others to also improve their own. She can also use it in order to identify genjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area.In the anime, Hinata can use infrared vision and magnify in to see tiny targets.By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra. <br><br>
            When she met Hamura, Hinata inherited some of his chakra because she is a member of the Hyūga clan's main house. It is the strength and purity of her chakra that attracts Toneri Ōtsutsuki. It is also because of her being the member of the Hyūga clan's main house and direct bloodline from Hamura that she can touch and find the Tenseigan, though she can't destroy it by herself, so instead she held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone without the Hyūga and Ōtsutsuki bloodline can't touch it.qAs is traditional in her clan, Hinata has been extensively trained in the Gentle Fist fighting style. In unison with her Byakugan, Hinata can attack accurately target an individuals' chakra pathway systems and the 361 tenketsu that run along it, constricting or cutting off their chakra flow from only minimal contact.Although this enables Hinata to attack an opponent's internal organs, she can also use it in a supplementary function, such as by setting dislocated shoulders back in place. <br><br>
            While Hinata hadn't yet mastered her clan's most advanced techniques in Part I, in the anime, she created the Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms as an alternative, which effectively protects her and attacks anything within range with sharp streams of chakra emitted from her palms. By Part II, she had grown accustomed to more of her clan's techniques. During Pain's Assault, Hinata could use the Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists, a technique that drains the target of their chakra when struck. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata could use the Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm to attack targets outside her physical range or deflect incoming attacks,which increases in power if used in conjunction with others. She also mastered the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms in the war. By the time she reached adulthood, she became well-known for her mastery of the Gentle Fist. As an adult, she could even knock out a target with a single strike to their tenketsu. <br><br>
            While Hinata doesn't usually use ninjutsu, by the Fourth Shinobi World War, her nature transformations included Fire and Lightning Release. In the anime, she also demonstrated proficiency in medical ninjutsu, able to use the Mystical Palm Technique to heal the wounded.
