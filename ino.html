        <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>
            Ino is the only child of Inoichi Yamanaka and was a popular student during her time in the Academy. There, she met Sakura Haruno, who was teased by other kids for her large forehead. Ino defended Sakura from the bullies and encouraged her to embrace her forehead rather than hide it, becoming good friends with her. Over the following years, Ino's guidance and friendship helped Sakura become more confident and develop into her own person. However, when Sakura found out that they had a crush on the same boy, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura approached Ino, telling her of her liking towards Sasuke. Sakura then took it to end their friendship, starting their dislike towards each other in the beginning of the series.

        <h1>PERSONALITY</h1>
        <p>
            From a young age, Ino has been a confident, bold and outspoken girl who had a mild-temper and occasionally lashed out at others if their personal habits bothered her. At the same time, she was by nature very friendly and loyal to her allies, usually more motivated than her team-mates, and tended to take charge of them, a characteristic she would later pass on to her son, Inojin. Shikamaru, despite finding most girls "troublesome", typically offers no resistance to Ino's forceful behaviour, being unwilling to deal with her reaction if things don't happen her way.She is also prideful in her appearance and often tries to lose weight by dieting in the hopes that it will make her more attractive to boys; she even jokingly suggests that Chōji should do the same to attract girls. Ino is quite knowledgeable about different types and meanings of flowers, sometimes making analogies to them when talking. <br><br>
            Despite her assertiveness and uppity demeanour, Ino is a compassionate and kind person at heart, having been raised to embody the meaning of the bush clover: a blunt, candid love who treasures the bonds with her friends. It is these qualities that earned Sakura Haruno's friendship, defending Sakura from bullies who teased her and helping her become confident.After the Chūnin Exams, Ino becomes impressed by Sakura's growth and they rekindle their friendship, while maintaining their rivalry on more amiable terms. She cares greatly for her teammates as well, being relieved that they survived after the failed Sasuke Recovery Mission, promising her sensei Asuma Sarutobi to look after them after he dies,and during the Fourth Shinobi World War, encouraging them to stay strong in the face of danger. By the time of his death, Inoichi believed that Ino had truly blossomed into the bush clover of the Yamanaka Clan, and is proud of her bonds with her friends. <br><br>
            After the fourth great ninja war, Ino married sai. Even after many years together Ino's love for Sai is as strong as ever, occasionally acting as love-struck as she did when they first met. As a mother, Ino's personality is relatively the same, but she has greater respect for her clan and its traditions, insisting they be passed down to the next generation to form a new Ino–Shika–Chō. However, she firmly believes in not pushing her son Inojin to do something he doesn't like, even if it's learning the Yamanaka Clan techniques. Ino strongly respects her father and tries her best to carry on his will in leading the clan. At the same time, she is reasonable enough to recognise that all people mature at their own rate and in their own ways, openly trusting her son to find his own path as a ninja.

        <h1 id="appearance">APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>
            Ino has fair skin, light blue eyes (sometimes seen as green in the manga), and long platinum blonde hair worn in a ponytail, with bangs framing the right side of her face. Her hair is seen in different lengths: in Part I, her ponytail extends to her waist, but it is later cut and grows to shoulder-length; in Part II, the bangs grow to cover half of her face, her ponytail becomes waist-length, and she sports a red clip on the left; in the The Last: Naruto the Movie, her hair is hung loosely and extends to her calves; as an adult, her hairstyle returns to its shape in Part II, but her ponytail reaches her upper-back and sports a black clip. By Part II, she developed a very shapely figure. Sai mentions that Ino is very beautiful. <br><br>
            Ino regularly wears a purple outfit consisting of a high-collared blouse and matching apron skirt. In Part I, she sports this attire with bandages on her abdomen and legs, small hoop-earrings, her forehead protector worn as a belt, and for a time, white arm warmers. In Part II, Ino's outfit is slightly more revealing as she discards her forehead protector and bandages while exposing her midriff and wears mesh armour on her thighs, elbows and knees. She also replaces her hoop earrings with studs, a gift from Asuma. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Ino dons the standard Konoha infantry flak jacket and assorted clothing. In The Last: Naruto the Movie, she wears a longer skirt that reaches her ankles, high-heeled sandals and pink lipstick. As an adult, Ino wears her purple outfit again exposing her midriff with one mesh warmer on her left arm and open-toed sandals. She also dons the standard Konoha uniform while on missions.

        <h1 id="abilities">ABILITIES</h1>
        <p>
            As a genin, Ino was noted to be an exceptional kunoichi by Asuma and by her father's admission a kunoichi with the potential to become the strongest member of the Yamanaka clan.During the time-skip, she becomes a chūnin, and her improved skills ultimately earned further praise from her father in the Fourth Shinobi World War.Around the era of the Seventh Hokage, Ino's talents made her the head of the Konoha Barrier Team. Many shinobi in the village and of her own clan look up to her. In the anime, she also works in the Analysis Team as an interrogator. <br><br>
            While a genin, Ino showed to be skilled at chakra control, as seen when she used her own cut hair to bind a target. In Part II, her chakra control improved greatly, having been made a medical-nin, and being chosen to help seal the Three-Tails. She could also transfer her chakra to others.Although Ino rarely uses taijutsu, she has proven to be skilled enough in her battle against Sakura during the Chūnin Exams and against a reincarnated Asuma in the Fourth Shinobi World War, a proficient taijutsu user himself. Ino has also shown impressive strength and speed, able to tackle Chōji (with increased weight from his enlarged arm) away from Asuma's Wind Release: Dust Cloud Technique. Two years after the war, while usually positioned near the back lines during close ranged combat situations, her taijutsu has improved enough to support Sai in defeating multiple enemies. <br><br>
            As a Yamanaka, Ino specialises in mind-affecting techniques, such as the Mind Body Switch Technique, which allows her to possess a target and take control of their actions. She can also use this technique on animals for reconnaissance and espionage, as it was originally intended. Ino's body, however, is left vulnerable to attack while the technique is active, and therefore it is not suited for battle.She can also be forced out of the body if the opponent's will is strong enough. In the anime, she learns the Mind Body Disturbance Technique, which allows her to force her enemies to attack each other.During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Ino's speed with the Mind Body Switch Technique has improved greatly and is able to quickly to save her allies from incoming danger on multiple occasions.Ino has also learned the Mind Clone Switch Technique, which allows her to control multiple targets at once.With the Mind Body Transmission Technique, she can communicate telepathically with someone, convey memories and feelings to them. She is quite skilled with this technique, able to connect the entire Allied Shinobi Forces through a telepathic link. She can also transmit what she senses into a target's mind. By making physical contact with a person, they can also communicate with one another while the technique is active.In The Last: Naruto the Movie, Ino's telepathic range has expanded enough to receive and broadcast messages across the Five Great Shinobi Countries in a short period of time.
