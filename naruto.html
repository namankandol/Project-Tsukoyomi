        <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>
            Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki (the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails). He was named after Naruto Musasabi, the protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the Sannin his godfather. <br><br>
            
            The Third Hokage made special arrangements for Minato to preserve Kushina's seal containing the Nine-Tails while she gave birth to Naruto in a remote location, escorted by midwives and Anbu. A masked man, Tobi, tracked down their location, however, killed the midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to quickly rescue him and teleport him to a safe house. <br><br>

            With Minato gone, Tobi captured Kushina and released the Nine-Tails from her, using it to devastate Konoha. Minato saved Kushina and left Naruto in her care before he went to protect the village, eventually defeating Tobi and freeing the Nine-Tails from Tobi's control. Returning to Naruto and Kushina's location, Minato realised the only way to stop the Nine-Tails was to seal it within Naruto, believing that his son would someday need the fox's power to defeat Tobi when he returned. Since the Nine-Tails' chakra was too immense to be sealed into an infant, Minato sacrificed his soul to split the fox's chakra in half, sealing the Yin half within himself and the Yang half within Naruto. After telling Naruto how much they loved him, Minato and Kushina succumbed to their wounds from protecting their son from the Nine-Tails and passed away. <br><br>

            Orphaned, not having parents or anyone else to provide for him, Naruto received monthly income from the village in order to afford daily necessities. Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen (third Hokage) wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies. Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the Third Hokage forbade anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as their parents did. However, Naruto's peers emulated their parents' hatred of him, despite not knowing why. This social isolation caused Naruto to crave acknowledgement, which he would gain by pulling pranks. <br><br>

        <h1>PERSONALITY</h1>
        <p>
            Naruto is noted as boisterous, exuberant, and unorthodox, quite similar to Hashirama Senju. He inherited his mother's verbal tic, as he ends his sentences with "Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!) when emotional. Though he responds best to competition and is not afraid to ask for assistance, Naruto is relatively naïve and slow to understand principles or situations. He often requires an oversimplified analogy in order to grasp explanations and can even prove forgetful. Naruto is aware of his faults and admits he acts strong to mask his embarrassment and frustration about them. Despite his naivety, Naruto can be quite observant, picking up on things others miss and retaining information casually gathered through conversation. <br><br>

            Another of Naruto's prominent traits is his desire for acknowledgement; his pranks around the village were for people to notice him, even if it meant by scolding him. Therefore, he dreamed of one day becoming Konoha's Hokage. Knowing his dream is a long, arduous and seemingly impossible path, Naruto developed his own nindō of never going back on his word. This life-long philosophy serves as the cornerstone of Naruto's great self-confidence; he believes he can accomplish any goal with enough hard work and perseverance, no matter what.<br><br>

            After the death of his master Jiraiya, talking to his father Minato and listening to Nagato's tragic story, Naruto grew to understand the destructive cycle of hatred and he vowed to break it in order to bring true peace to the world. <br><br>

            As an adult, Naruto becomes wiser and more mature, though he retains some of his negligence for honourifics. Naruto also tends to be more responsible in his duties as Hokage and as a father. Nevertheless, Naruto profoundly loves his family, as he creates shadow clones to tend to them while he's busy, protects them in times of danger, spends time with them when he can, and expresses pride in his children's successes. He adopts Hiruzen's philosophy that everyone in the village is his family, believing that genuine relationships are made up of love rather than blood relations.

        <h1 id="appearance">APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>
            According to Jiraiya, Naruto strongly resembles his father.He has yellow-blond, spiky hair and blue eyes, while inheriting the shape of his mother's eyes and face.His trademark characteristics are the three whisker markings on his cheeks. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Dan Katō initially mistook Naruto for Nawaki due to their stark resemblance.Naruto was rather short for his age during Part I,though he grew to be taller than Sakura in Part II. Naruto originally wore green goggles on his forehead, though he discarded them upon becoming a genin. <br><br>
            In Part I, Naruto wore an orange and blue jacket with a white collar, a white swirl with a tassel on the left side, and a red Uzumaki crest on the back. He also wore orange pants with a shuriken holster on his right knee, blue sandals, and a blue forehead protector, given to him by Iruka after graduating from the Academy. In Part II, Naruto wears a more form fitting outfit after wearing out his original one while training with Jiraiya,with a T-shirt or mesh armour underneath. While retaining the swirls and orange pants, the blue pieces of his outfit changes to black: his forehead protector (which is now longer), sandals, and orange jacket, the black colour showing more prominence than the blue did originally. During his battle with Pain, Naruto briefly wore a short-sleeved red coat with a black flame pattern around the hem and carried a large scroll on his back. <br><br>
            Naruto loses his right arm after the Fourth Shinobi World War, though it is later replaced by a fully maneuverable prosthetic arm made of Hashirama Senju's cells, wrapped completely in bandages. In The Last: Naruto the Movie, Naruto grew again to be one of the tallest of his graduating class, cut his hair short, and wore a black elastic forehead protector. Over his pants and sandals, he wears a black uniform jacket with an orange zipper and buttons on the waist and sleeves, which can be folded up at times. He has a red armband with an Uzumaki crest on his left arm. After becoming Hokage, Naruto dons a garment similar to his father's: a white cape that has a red flame pattern around the hem, is held together by a red rope, and has the kanji for "Seventh Hokage'' written vertically down the back. Underneath this, he wears an orange sweatshirt with black stripes (reverse in the manga version of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations), black pants and sandals. He occasionally wears the traditional Hokage headpiece, but has stopped wearing a forehead protector.

        <h1 id="abilities">ABILITIES</h1>
        <p>
            Originally, Naruto was a rather inept ninja, failing to graduate from the Academy three times. Through sheer determination and training however, his skills rapidly improved to defeat strong genin like Neji Hyūga, Gaara, and Kabuto Yakushi, earning acknowledgement from all the Sannin for his potential.Under various tutelage, Naruto was able to defeat various members of Akatsuki, ultimately earning praise from Konohagakure as a Hokage-material hero.Naruto's personally defeated various reincarnated Kage and jinchūriki during the Fourth Shinobi World War. Many believe Naruto was the central key to winning the war. By adulthood, his prowess made him the Seventh Hokage, regarded as the strongest shinobi in history and having command of overwhelming jutsu.Against an Inner like Delta, Naruto proved able to decisively defeat the cyborg while still holding back considerably to capture her alive. With the combined might of Sasuke Uchiha, noted as his only rival as a shinobi,they are said able to destroy a continent. Together, they overpowered Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, and pushed Isshiki Ōtsutsuki's vessel to its limit, with the latter admitting that his vessel was too weak to defeat Naruto without his assistance. When fighting at his absolute peak(Baryon mode), Naruto was able to overcome Isshiki himself in a way that risked his life. <br><br>
            As an Uzumaki and a reincarnation of Asura Ōtsutsuki, Naruto has massive reserves of strong chakra, at least four times greater than Kakashi, and described by Karin as "bright and warm." His initial poor control of it was offset by his sheer reserves,which were large enough to endure three and a half days of constant battle against several powerful opponents. Only by the end of his battle against Sasuke did he show exhaustion, and even then could still fight to a standstill and eventual victory.He often utilised shadow clones in large if not massive numbers to simply overwhelm his foes. Although these tactics resumed later, Naruto became much more adept at taijutsu due to Jiraiya's training.Originally as the jinchūriki of Kurama's Yang half, Naruto had access to massive reserves of exceptionally powerful chakra, which was at least a hundredfold greater than Kakashi.These chakra levels were increased even further when the Yin half of Kurama was reunited with the Yang half inside of Naruto. Due to his inheriting his mother's unique chakra capacities and being Kurama's jinchūriki for essentially his entire life, Naruto's chakra has properly mixed with the fox's, allowing him to perform several chakra-taxing techniques unhindered. <br><br>
            After losing his right arm during his final battle with Sasuke, Tsunade cultured an artificial prosthesis for him using the cells of Hashirama Senju. As his body and the prosthesis arms are only connected through his chakra itself he can easily remove and replace them.After Momoshiki's defeat, Naruto took inspiration from his chakra absorption technique and had Katasuke Tōno and the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team modified the arm further with mechanical features. With it, Naruto is able to neutralise and even absorb enemy techniques, though they have yet to replicate Momoshiki's ability to discharge them as a counterattack. <br><br>
            Naruto's second trademark technique is the Rasengan. Originally, due to his poor chakra control, Naruto had to use a shadow clone to form the spherical shape while he provided the chakra. Over time, Naruto developed larger versions of the Rasengan and learned how to perform it faster.During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he learned to use the Rasengan and its variants unaided with a single hand, or even form one in both hands simultaneously.He also increased the size of his standard Rasengan.Naruto had also shown the ability to release the Rasengan as an energy wave, or as a projectile in the anime. Using senjutsu or Kurama's chakra, Naruto can create more powerful and elaborate variations of the Rasengan; using the latter, he even developed the Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball, performing it in a similar manner to the Rasengan. In the anime, usage of his tailed beast chakra also allows him to instantly perform massive Rasengan without the aid of his hands and launch in quick succession, similar to a Tailed Beast Ball. <br><br>
            Naruto's natural affinity is Wind Release. Using shadow clones, one to form the Rasengan while another infuses the Wind chakra, Naruto could complete difficult task of producing a Rasengan that is the pinnacle of shape and nature transformation, something no one before him could accomplish, including Kakashi and his father. Once adjusting to using the Wind Release: Rasengan he could expand upon it to produce the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. He also created different-sized variations, and could even use two Rasenshuriken Simultaneously. Two years after its creation, he became skilled enough to form a Rasenshuriken without any shadow clones and throw it in his base form, a feat which he previously could only do while using his enhanced modes.After gaining the Six Paths Senjutsu, Naruto can utilise all basic five nature transformations, as well as Yin–Yang Release. He could make perfect use of the latter to revitalise life-forces, heal whomever he touches, and restore missing organs. After gaining chakra from the respective tailed beasts, Naruto can also use Shukaku's Magnet Release, Son Gokū's Lava Release, and Kokuō's Boil Release, able to infuse any of the other elements into is normal techniques as seamlessly as with Wind chakra. <br><br>
            Naruto later trained in senjutsu at Mount Myōboku, which was only possible due to his high chakra reserves. Unlike Jiraiya, he was able to perfectly balance natural energy with his chakra, and enter a complete Sage Mode, symbolised by the orange pigmentation around his eyes and no other alterations to his appearance. Using Sage Mode made Naruto's techniques stronger, enhanced his physical parameters,utilise the Frog Kata taijutsu style,and sense chakra through advanced enough to identify different signatures from vast distances.Since Fukasaku was unable to fuse with Naruto and gather natural energy for him due to Kurama's interference, Naruto had to employ shadow clones instead to maintain the technique, taking advantage of the clones' own buildup of natural energy being transferred to the original and let him use Sage Mode a number of times. However, creating more than five shadow clones overall would disrupt the focus of the clones gathering natural energy. The need for this method diminishes over time as Naruto became capable of entering Sage Mode much faster.However, after finding unity with Kurama, Naruto overcame this problem and learned to combine Sage Mode with Kurama's chakra to further enhance his abilities, such that he could resist Nagato's control and shatter Truth-Seeking Balls. <br><br>
            Naruto also gained access to the Six Paths Senjutsu , which allowed him to fly and also manifest up to nine Truth-Seeking Balls, composed of all five basic natures, Yin–Yang Release, and imbue them with the Six Paths Sage Chakra. He could mould the balls into a myriad of shapes, fire them as projectiles and still control them from distance, or convert them into Tailed Beast Balls and use them to create Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken. While his shadow clones are unable to produce Truth-Seeking Balls of their own, Naruto is able to transfer control of his own to any of his shadow clones. <br><br>
            With the power given to him by Hagoromo, Naruto gained access to the Six Paths Sage Mode . In this mode, his pupils take on a cross-like shape — without manifesting the orange pigmentation around his eyes present in Sage Mode. Going further, Naruto donned a new Nine-Tails Chakra Mode cloak, which he could access instantly and maintain much longer than his standard Sage Mode.Naruto's physical attributes and techniques are further augmented, to the point where he could dodge attacks that moved at the speed of light and deflect Truth-Seeking Balls. It also empowers his sensory abilities to the highest possible level,which allowed him to sense the invisible shadows of Limbo.Naruto also retained use of his Tailed Beast Mode avatar of Kurama, which rivalled Sasuke's Rinnegan-empowered Complete Body — Susanoo in size and might. Using shadow clones, he could create and combine three Kurama avatars into a single construct with three faces and six arms, similar to Asura's. This state allowed Naruto to infuse two massive Rasenshuriken with natural energy. <br><br>
            While headstrong and often acting without thinking, Naruto's years as a prankster had given him a cunning imagination that was useful in split-second decision making, which has repeatedly proved invaluable in battle. He is a remarkable tactile learner, able to learn better through executing a task rather than understanding the theory of it.Once seen in action, even the likes of the Second Hokage revise their thoughts about Naruto's intellect and instinct in battle.After meeting Hagoromo, Naruto gained the innate ability to grasp the nature of chakra and comprehend all universal things,allowing him to quickly master the new powers he received. By adulthood he had become a capable teacher, instructing students at Konoha's Ninja Academy. During his fight with Delta, Naruto showed his ability to think ahead by hiding his power and faking defeat in order to make Delta drop her guard and reveal her plans, although Delta was perceptive enough to see through his attempts. Naruto ultimately was able to find out the weakness of Delta's Shinobi-Ware absorbing eye and overtax it after seeing it in action repeatedly. <br><br>
            Naruto's most famous mental skill is to deceive his opponents, as he made effective use of even the most simple techniques to trick the deadliest of opponents.He could formulate multi-step plans or backup plans in the thick of battle,and act quickly even when given new information. He can also seemingly make himself predictable by creating a pattern, only to throw off his opponent by breaking it. He has even thrown in what others would call completely useless techniques at powerful opponents to create an opening for a counterattack. Naruto is rather observant, able to notice details others may overlook and subsequently take advantage of them to overcome his opponents. As an adult, Naruto proved to be a capable teacher in ninjutsu, quickly teaching the basics to Kawaki.
