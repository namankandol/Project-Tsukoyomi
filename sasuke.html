        <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>
            Sasuke is the second and youngest son of Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha.On entering the Konoha Ninja Academy, Sasuke proved to be the standout of his class, consistently getting top grades and displaying signs of becoming a great shinobi. <br> <br>
            Sasuke grew up in the shadow of his older brother, Itachi, a natural prodigy who many in the Uchiha clan and the village would constantly compare Sasuke and any of his accomplishments to.Sasuke himself adored Itachi, never passing up an opportunity to spend time with him. Although Itachi welcomed his company, letting Sasuke watch him train and taking him on adventures into the forests.Itachi in return rarely helped Sasuke himself become a better shinobi; when asked, he would often instead poke Sasuke's forehead and promise to do so some other time. Sasuke found this annoying, but didn't allow it to blemish his high opinion of his brother. <br> <br>
            Sasuke, now one of the last surviving Uchiha, was alone. He spent the first few days after the massacre wandering his family's compound, reflecting on the people who were now gone, killed by Itachi. Sasuke decided to do what Itachi had instructed and dedicated his life to vengeance, having no other interest than bringing about Itachi's death. He threw himself into his studies at the Academy, making no efforts to form friendships and ignoring all of the girls' attempts to gain his affection.He later went on to kill itachi and thus completed his only dream.He later regretted his act on learning the truth about itachi. <br>

Sasuke adored Itachi when he was a boy, enjoying his company above all others.As an infant, he would cry whenever he was held by someone besides Itachi and would immediately be happy once held by his big brother again. <br><br>

        <h1 id="appearance">APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>
            Sasuke bears a strong resemblance to Izuna Uchiha. He has black eyes and spiky black hair with a blue tint. Sasuke's hair is long and has hung over his face as bangs since he was a child, which as he gets older allows  to grow longer and, in turn, cover more of his face. After acquiring his Rinnegan, Sasuke grew his hair to cover the left side of his face, notably the eye. He is considered handsome by most girls near his age. <br><br>
            For most of the Naruto series, he wears a navy blue, short-sleeved shirt with a high collar, white shorts and white arm warmers. He wears a blue-clothed forehead protector with both of these outfits, but starts wearing it less and less after being hospitalised by Itachi, finally abandoning it entirely at the end of Naruto. <br><br>
            In Naruto Shippuden, he consistently wears dark blue pants, over which hangs a blue cloth that covers him from his stomach to his knees, which he secures with a purple rope belt. He complements this with a white long-sleeved shirt kept open at the torso and black arm guards that cover his forearms. He switches after Itachi's death, wearing a white (grey in the anime) zippered, high-collared, short-sleeved shirt and blue wrist warmers. He wears a hooded cloak over his clothing at different points, usually, an unadorned black one during his pursuit of Itachi alongside Hebi, and for a brief time, sported the trademark Akatsuki cloak, only with a hood instead of the regular high collar. <br><br>
            At the beginning of Boruto series, the colour scheme of Sasuke's outfit is revised, having his black cloak gain a storm flap, a maroon cinch on the collar, and maroon lining. His long-sleeved shirt gains light grey cuffs, and he wears a pair of brown leather belts with a black sheath for his sword, a brown shuriken holster, and brown shinobi boots. Whilst in the past, Sasuke wears a long trench coat over his outfit, and a fedora hat to hide his identity, and when not wearing his fedora, Sasuke sports an eyepatch over his left eye to hide his Rinnegan.

        <p>
            Like his older brother Itachi, Sasuke is recognised as a natural prodigy of the Uchiha clan, graduating at the top of his class in the Academy.Sasuke's chakra is quite strong, in part due to being the reincarnation of Indra Ōtsutsuki.His reserves are also quite large, enough to use Chidori twice a day during academy years without aid. By Part II, Sasuke is able to use Chidori and related techniques multiple times in a single day, as well as summon creatures as large as Manda. <br><br>
            Sasuke is very capable in taijutsu, enough to hold his own in hand-to-hand combat against multiple opponents at once. His most consistent physical display is his speed, and by extension his reaction time. He has great analytical skills and uses it to his benefit to take down formidable opponents. He earned praise for his analytical skills from Minato Namikaze and Madara Uchiha too. <br><br>
            Sasuke’s other abilities in the series are: Pheonix Flower Jutsu, Lions Barrage, Hidden Shadow Snake Hands, Orochimaru Style: Body Replacement Technique, Summoning: Manda and garuda, 
             Chidori,
             Mangekyo sharingan,
             Sword Of Kusanagi: Chidori Katana,
             Amaterasu,
             Six Paths Of Yin Power,
             Susanoo,
             Kirin,
             Blaze Release: Susanoo Kagutsuchi,
