        <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>
            Since her time as a student in the Academy, Tenten had a goal to become a legendary kunoichi like Tsunade, one of the Sannin, which she openly shared to others. After graduating, she was assigned to the jōnin tutelage of Might Guy, alongside her classmates Rock Lee and Neji Hyūga. For their final test to become genin, Guy forced his potential students to spar him and see their commitment to succeed. Ultimately, all three passed.During this time of trial and failure, trying to emulate Tsunade, Tenten attempted to become a medical-nin, building up her raw strength and such. While each failed attempt was damaging to her pride, Tenten later discovered her talent for fūinjutsu and thus developed her unique fighting style. Realising her own nature, she stopped trying to become like Tsunade, but still has not given up on her dream of becoming a legendary kunoichi in her own right. Later, Tenten and her teammates were offered the chance to enter the Chūnin Exams in the possibility of being promoted to said rank. However, all three decided to pass on the exams for the time being to further hone their skills.

        <h1>PERSONALITY</h1>
        <p>
            Tenten is depicted as naturally inquisitive and observant, with a personal dream to become a legendary kunoichi like Tsunade. This has led to her to become strongly opinionated about women, defending that girls can be just as skilled as boys in taijutsu when Neji thought otherwise. Tenten exhibits a distaste for weakness or being overly dependent on other people. Though she can be quite fierce at times, Tenten is kind and caring toward others, comforting her friends when they are going through a hard time. <br><br>
            Being around her overly enthusiastic teammates, particularly Might Guy and Rock Lee, Tenten is often left exasperated at their antics and wishes they would behave more maturely; her Infinite Tsukuyomi dream actually depicts this. She is more easy-going and dislikes having to travel for whole days or continue training when she is already tired, for which reason she enjoys her days-off from missions. However, she cares greatly about her team, helping to save Lee during the Chūnin Exams when he didn't report back at their base. She also held great respect for her other teammate Neji Hyūga and often helped him train. <br><br>
            Naturally Tenten, who was a ninja-tool user, loves ninja weapons to the point that she collects every ninja tool from all over the world as a hobby. Moreover, her hobby developed so much that she even opened a full-fledged ninja tool shop.She also appears to have a fascination with the supernatural, believing in ghosts and the likes.

        <h1 id="appearance">APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>
            Tenten has black hair and grey eyes, both of which are depicted as dark brown in the anime. She wears her hair in two Chinese-style buns on her head with short fringe-bangs framing her face. She keeps this hairstyle consistent throughout Parts I and II. In The Last: Naruto the Movie, her hair buns are braided and held together by a short plait that falls just below her shoulders. As an adult, her braided-buns are still kept, but her straight bangs cover her forehead. <br><br>
            Tenten's outfits serve as a reference to Chinese culture. In Part I, she wears a pink sleeveless qipao-style blouse (initially depicted as blue in the manga) with red sleeve trimmings and yellow fastening buttons and dark green pants. A pouch is adjusted to her thigh and her forehead protector and sandals are both blue. In Part II, Tenten sports a long-sleeved, high-collared white blouse with maroon edges, black fingerless gloves, low-heeled sandals and a black forehead protector. She wears maroon, puffy hakama-style pants with the exposed parts covered in bandages and the shuriken holster removed. She usually carries a large scroll behind her back. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tenten wears the standard Konoha infantry flak jacket and assorted clothing, along with a holster around her waist that carries two small scrolls. <br><br>
            As an adult, Tenten once again wears the similar outfit she wore in Part II with the pants being peach-coloured. She also sports red dangling tassel-like earrings.

        <h1 id="abilities">ABILITIES</h1>
        <p>
            Tenten is a highly skilled and capable kunoichi; her skills being held in high regard by her team. By Part II, she became a chūnin,capable of pressuring the likes of Kisame Hoshigaki with the aid of her teammates.As an adult, Tenten is remarked as a kunoichi who excelled at space–time ninjutsu,which she can use to summon puppets equipped with a kunai-firing gun.Tenten is able to wield a variety of weapons with great proficiency, such as the manriki-gusari and bō. She could even effectively wield a weapon that she had no prior knowledge on, like the Jidanda and Bashōsen. Also, as noted by her teammates, Tenten is an excellent marksman, hitting 100/100 marks each time.By adulthood, Tenten is considered to be Konoha's top weapon user. <br><br>
            Tenten is very skilled in the use of fūinjutsu. Her usual method is to store a numerous amount of weapons into her scrolls, which she can later unseal to bombard her opponents with. She could attach explosive tags to the weapons to make them more lethal, and use wire strings to better guide the weapons' trajectory. In the anime, she could use her two small scrolls to perform the Twin Rising Dragons, a technique where she manually launches a variety of weapons in rapid succession. In Part II, she wields a large scroll, which carries even more weapons. In the anime, she can use the scroll to perform the Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain Disaster, a technique that rains down a multitude of weapons onto an opponent and covers a wide range. <br><br>
            In the anime, Tenten has shown to seal more than just weapons into her scrolls, such as a fire dragon that explodes upon contact,and a metal dome for defence against attacks. She can even store objects as large as a ship, or a large body of water.
